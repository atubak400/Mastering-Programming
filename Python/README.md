## The Sum Calculator
The Sum Calculator is a simple Python program that allows you to calculate the sum of a list of numbers entered by the user. It provides a straightforward way to quickly obtain the sum of numeric values without the need for complex calculations.
### How It Works
The program consists of three main functions:
*get_numbers(): This function prompts the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. It then converts the input into a list of numeric values, which is returned as the result.
*calculate_sum(numbers): This function takes the list of numbers obtained from get_numbers() and calculates their sum using a simple algorithm. The result, which is the sum of the numbers, is returned.
*display_result(sum): Finally, this function displays the calculated sum to the user, making it easy to view and work with the result.
### Usage
To use the List Sum Calculator, follow these steps:
* Run the program.
* Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces when prompted.
* The program will calculate the sum of the entered numbers.
* The sum will be displayed to the user for reference.
### Example
Here's an example of how you can use the List Sum Calculator:
```python
Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces: 5 10 15 20
The sum of the numbers is: 50
```
### Compatibility
The List Sum Calculator is written in Python and should work on most systems with a Python interpreter installed.
