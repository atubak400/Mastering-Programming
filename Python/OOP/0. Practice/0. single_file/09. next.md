# OOP Concepts

* Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
 It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple classes in a consistent way. 
 Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and interfaces (in languages like Java) or function overloading 
 (in languages like C++).

* Composition: Composition is a design principle in which complex objects are created by combining simpler objects. 
It allows you to create classes that have attributes and methods that rely on other objects. 
This is an alternative to inheritance for building complex relationships between classes.

* Association and Aggregation: These are relationship types between classes. Association represents a general 
relationship, while aggregation represents a more specific "whole-part" relationship. Understanding these 
relationships helps in modeling complex.

* Encapsulation and Data Hiding: Controlling the access to an object's data by using 
access modifiers (public, private, protected) to hide the internal details and expose only what is necessary.
