To improve this application, taking advantage of the encapsulation started with the SumCalculator class, you can add more features and make the code more modular and extensible. Here are some ideas for improving the application:

Error Handling: Implement error handling to deal with cases where user input is not valid (e.g., non-numeric input). You can add error messages and gracefully handle exceptions.

Input Validation: Validate user input to ensure it meets specific criteria (e.g., positive numbers only). You can encapsulate input validation logic within the SumCalculator class or in a separate validator class.

Additional Calculations: Expand the SumCalculator class to handle other mathematical operations, such as calculating the average, minimum, or maximum of a list of numbers.

Logging: Add logging functionality to keep a record of user interactions, errors, or results. This can help with debugging and auditing.

Multiple User Sessions: Modify the application to support multiple user sessions or calculations in one run.

Input Sources: Allow input from sources other than user input. For example, you can read input from a file or a database.

Command-Line Arguments: Accept command-line arguments to customize the behavior of the program, such as specifying the operation to perform or input source.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Create a graphical user interface to make the application more user-friendly. Tools like Tkinter or PyQt can help you build a simple GUI for your calculator.

Unit Testing: Write unit tests for the SumCalculator class and other functions to ensure they work as expected. This can help you catch bugs early and make future enhancements with confidence.

Documentation: Add comments and docstrings to your code to make it more understandable for other developers and for future reference.

Extensibility: Design your code with future enhancements in mind. Keep it modular and loosely coupled so that you can easily add new features or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the code.

User-Friendly Output: Improve the way results are displayed to the user. For instance, you can provide more descriptive messages and formatting options.
